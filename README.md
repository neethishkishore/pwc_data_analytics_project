In this data analytics project, I leveraged Microsoft Power BI to delve into the operational metrics of a call center, aiming to enhance its overall performance and customer satisfaction. The project focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Speed of Answer, Number of Calls per Month, Average Satisfaction Rating, and the Percentage of Answered and Resolved Calls.

1. Average Speed of Answer

2. Number of Calls per Month

3. Average Satisfaction Rating

4. Answered and Resolved Calls
